# Food Recognition System

A robust food recognition system that uses a custom-trained deep learning model to identify food items from images. The project integrates advanced neural networks with a .NET backend for smooth deployment and real-time predictions.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of food items for recognition.
- **Accurate Predictions:** The system provides reliable identification using a trained model.
- **.NET Integration:** Backend powered by .NET for efficient processing and deployment.
- **Real-Time Results:** Fast inference for immediate feedback.

## How It Works

1. **Image Input:** Users upload a food image via the application interface.
2. **Model Inference:** The image is processed by the deep learning model to predict the food category.
3. **Result Display:** The predicted food item and confidence score are shown to the user.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-recognition-system.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Ensure you have Python (for model) and .NET installed.  
   Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**  
   Start the backend server and frontend interface as described in the project documentation.

## Model Training

- The model was trained on a curated dataset of food images.
- Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high accuracy.
- Training scripts and instructions are available in the `model/` directory.

## Technologies Used

- Python (for model training and inference)
- .NET (for backend integration)
- Deep Learning Frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch)
